  <p2>Born in White Plains, New York, Zuckerberg attended Harvard University, where he launched the Facebook social networking service from his dormitory room on February 4, 2004, with college roommates Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin
    Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes.[6] Originally launched to select college campuses, the site expanded rapidly and eventually beyond colleges, reaching one billion users by 2012. Zuckerberg took the company public in May 2012 with majority shares. His
    net worth is estimated to be nearly $82 billion as of February 2019, increasing over the past year with Facebook stock as a whole.[7] In 2007, at age 23, he became the world's youngest self-made billionaire. As of 2019, he is the only person
    under 50 in the Forbes ten richest people list, and the only one under 40 in the Top 20 Billionaires list.</p2>
